        Jews wrote and performed plays in Yiddish throughout the world as a part of the Yiddish Theatre. The
        range was broad: opera, comedy, satire, melodrama, realism. The great-grandmother of the narrator acted in the
        Yiddish Theatre, performing at the Café Savoy in Prague, watched by Franz Kafka and Max Brod. She
        was a member of Yitzhak Lowy’s troupe, a man she adored, but who broke her heart. Lowy had an idea for a play he
        never finished writing, called <em>The Broken Vow</em>, and he told his idea to S. Ansky on a train in 1913;
        Ansky then
        stole his idea and wrote the most famous play of the Yiddish Theatre, <em>The Dybbuk</em>. <em>The Dybbuk</em>
        is considered a
        revolutionary play in both Yiddish and mainstream theatre. It’s been translated into many languages and is still
        performed regularly all over the world.

        Our narrator, ____, finds a book in the library of Oblivion written by his friend, Józef, titled <em>A Nearly
          Illustrated History of the Yiddish Theatre in Europe</em>. In it are pictures and descriptions of actors and
        plays
        ___ has seen while traveling through Time in Oblivion, and then a blank page, with this caption:
        <br><br>
        <i>From a production of <em style="font-style: normal">The Broken Vow</em>, Prague, 1919, Yitzhak Lowy’s troupe.
          Herschel Lowenstein as Chonen ben
          Nissn and Hanna Reimer as Leah.</i>
        <br><br>
        ____ says this is the “commemoration of an unwritten play performed by a non-existent cast.”
        <br><br>
        Dybbuks are spirits of dead people who possess the bodies of the living. In Oblivion, if one travels too much
        throughout Time, one can become a dybbuk, which is even worse than being a customer in the Café of Minor
        Authors.
