      <p *ngIf="infoVisible"> The Oliver No. 5 (produced 1907–1914) was Franz Kafka’s writing instrument of choice. The
        Oliver Typewriter Co.
        billed it as “the ‘last word’ in typewriters—a Symphony in Steel. It is scientific in principle, flawless in
        construction, accurate in adjustment, splendidly efficient in operation.”</p>

      <p><i>“The asbestos factory, gifted to K by his ever-practical father, seemed merely an abstract concept until the
          day that K decided on a whim to pay a visit to the building and the forlorn district in which it was located
          ...”</i>

      <p id="winner">
        It was the middle of a typical Bohemian winter whose dry and airy embrace reminded K of the way
        his governess Jaroslava would pinch his nostrils in the morning to wake him up for Latin lessons at the
        Gymnasium Franz Jozef. Despite the abundance of beggars, drunk Moravians, and amputated children, the manager of
        the factory, Herr Samsa was doing his best to spread holiday cheer through the quarter. Samsa once had a smaller
        asbestos business of his own, but it was unable to compete with the factory after it adopted the labor-saving
        devices of one Dr. Rossum. Now, he was standing over the company creche, sprinkling asbestos over the manger,
        magi, and barn animals. K watched as he grabbed a handful of the wooly material out of a bag tucked under his
        arm and ground it between his fingers. The results piled up and began to imitate the aftermath of a rare
        Palestinian blizzard. One flake fell on the head of the infant savior, and Samsa quickly brushed it aside. He
        noticed K and explained that snow could never fall on Christ because of his halo. Samsa added that he was unsure
        if such a spiritual device could melt asbestos, especially if it came from the factory K
        had just been gifted.
